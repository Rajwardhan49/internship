During my internship at InternPe, I embarked on a transformative journey to master Python programming, which has since become an integral part of my skill set. 
This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also provided invaluable insights into real-world applications of Python in a professional setting.
I had to complete just 3 tasks to complete this 1-month internship and since I had good command of Python, it was fairly easy for me to complete their tasks.

The first task was to develop a digital clock using Python modules.
The second task was to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.
The third waas Connect-4-Simulationmodel using python libraries.
